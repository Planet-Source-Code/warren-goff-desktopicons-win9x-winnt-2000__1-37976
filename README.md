## DesktopIcons \(Win9X & WinNT/2000\)


</div>

### Description

You will note that this works for both Win 9X and WinNT/2000!!! I take no credit for this code as I found it and altered it only slightly to save the icon positions for a given resolution. Frankly, I am a novice at API and much of this is over my head.  The code saves the current Desktop Icon positions.  You may move them around as you choose and then restore them.  It saves the data to a file for each resolution you choose.  Sort of like EasyDesk
